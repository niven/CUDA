This is the code I worte for the assignments for a Coursera course.

This is cool stuff that takes advantage of the many processors in your GPU to do cool stuff.

The downside is that this was all done on an Amazon EC2 thingamajig and #includes some stuff I don't have but was provided. You would have to replace that with your own which is not hard but annoying. You also need a graphics card that can actually run this stuff.

If you are doing another instance of this course I suggest doing your homework yourself because then you will actually learn cool stuff.
